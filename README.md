## Troubleshooting

Less extends Sublime Text's CSS syntax definition as of ST4149.

If Less syntax highlighting doesn't work and console displays syntax errors in _Less.sublime-syntax_, please make sure to remove any out-dated syntax override.

Steps:

1. call _Menu > Preferences > Browse Packages.._
2. Look for _CSS_ folder
3. Remove it or at least delete any _CSS.sublime-syntax_ in it
